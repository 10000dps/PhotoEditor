## FAQ
<details>
    <summary>Can I use this library in my app for free?</summary>
    <p>
        Yes. It's an open-source library and free to use. If this library has saved your time then showing a little
        credit will increase my motivation towards making the library better :)

<details>
    <summary>Does it support the CROP feature?</summary>
    <p>
        Currently, No. I started to build in branch <a
        href="https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor/issues/79">PE-79</a>. But due to time constraint, I drop the
        idea. Any PR related to CROP is welcomed :)

<details>
    <summary>Facing issues in applying Filter?</summary>
    <p>
        The filter effect is applied using `GlSurfaceView` and the implementation of this feature causing a lot of
        issues. Need to think of some other alternative solution. Here is the issue <a
        href="https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+filter">list</a>.

<details>
    <summary>Does is support in other platforms (iOS, Web, Flutter)?</summary>
    <p>
        No. Currently, the focus is on making the android library better. We don't have any plans for <a
        href="https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor/issues/24">other Platform</a>.
