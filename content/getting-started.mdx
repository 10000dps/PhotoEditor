To start with this, you need to just simply add the dependencies in the gradle file of app module like this
```bash
implementation 'ja.burhanrashid52:photoeditor:1.1.0'
```
or you can also import the :photoeditor module from the sample for customization


## Setting up the View
First, you need to add `PhotoEditorView` in your XML layout

```java
 <ja.burhanrashid52.photoeditor.PhotoEditorView
        android:id="@+id/photoEditorView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:photo_src="@drawable/got_s" />

```
You can define your drawable or color resource directly using `app:photo_src`

Your can set the image programmatically by getting source from `PhotoEditorView` which will return a `ImageView` so that you can load image from resources,file or (Picasso/Glide)
```java
PhotoEditorView mPhotoEditorView = findViewById(R.id.photoEditorView);

mPhotoEditorView.getSource().setImageResource(R.drawable.got);
```

## Building a PhotoEditor
To use the image editing feature you need to build a PhotoEditor which requires a Context and PhotoEditorView which we have set up in our XML layout


```java
//Use custom font using latest support library
Typeface mTextRobotoTf = ResourcesCompat.getFont(this, R.font.roboto_medium);

//loading font from assest
Typeface mEmojiTypeFace = Typeface.createFromAsset(getAssets(), "emojione-android.ttf");

mPhotoEditor = new PhotoEditor.Builder(this, mPhotoEditorView)
         .setPinchTextScalable(true)
         .setDefaultTextTypeface(mTextRobotoTf)
         .setDefaultEmojiTypeface(mEmojiTypeFace)
         .build();
 ```
You can customize the properties in the PhotoEditor as per your requirement

| Property  | Usage |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `setPinchTextScalable()`  | set false to disable pinch to zoom on text insertion.By deafult its true
| `setDefaultTextTypeface()`   | set default text font to be added on image  |
| `setDefaultEmojiTypeface()`  | set default font specifc to add emojis |

That's it we are done with setting up our library
