Introducing filter feature from version 0.2.0. Now you can apply a filter effect on the source image.

There are two ways you can apply the filter on the source image


## Inbuild Filters

By default, this library provides few commonly used filters . The listing of this filters is defined in the `PhotoFilter` enum. You can apply filter image using the following API

```java
mPhotoEditor.setFilterEffect(PhotoFilter.BRIGHTNESS);
```

## Custom Filter
In some cases, you want to have a custom filter in which can easily apply using a `CustomEffect` builder which requires an `EffecFactory` name and the value of its parameters

```java
CustomEffect customEffect = new CustomEffect.Builder(EffectFactory.EFFECT_BRIGHTNESS)
                .setParameter("brightness", 0.5f)
                .build();
mPhotoEditor.setFilterEffect(customEffect);
```
It will throw a runtime exception if the effect name is empty

**Note:** Check all the available filters on `EffectFactory` [Documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/effect/EffectFactory)

## Limitation
 - Image filter is based upon the MediaEffect support library. So only limited filters are available on EffectFacctory
 - Filter feature is designed in a way that filter will apply to the source image, it wont work on the apply effect like paint, sticker, text, and emoji
