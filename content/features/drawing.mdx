We can customize our brush and paint with the different set of property. To start drawing on the image we need to enable the drawing mode

| Type  | Method |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Enable/Disable  | `mPhotoEditor.setBrushDrawingMode(true);` |
| Bursh Size (px)  | `mPhotoEditor.setBrushSize(brushSize)` |
| Color Opacity (In %)  |   `mPhotoEditor.setOpacity(opacity)`  |
| Brush Color | `mPhotoEditor.setBrushColor(colorCode)`  |
| Brush Eraser  | `mPhotoEditor.brushEraser()` |

**Note**: Whenever you set any property for the brush for drawing it will automatically enable the drawing mode
